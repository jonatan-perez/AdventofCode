# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Each puzzle is created in advance by Eric Wastl and released at midnight in Eastern Standard Time. Puzzles consist of two parts that must be solved in order. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards. [1] [2]
